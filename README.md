# Josephine
A Discord Bot for auditing messages and other miscellaneous functions

This is a Discord bot that will read messages in a server and provide information on them, including how many messages a person has posted, the average number of messages a user posts, common words they will use, as well as providing graphs of how much activity a user has over time. Use **!info** or **!graph** and tag a user or channel to see this information. **!count** can be used to determine how many times a word has been said by each person or channel in a server. Messages are cached and her dictionaries are regenerated automatically every 30 minutes. 

For moderation functions, Josephine can also list all users' last message time and add or remove roles depending on when their last message was using **!listlastmessage** and **!roleadd**. She can list users by a set of roles by using **!rolehas** and adding role names or tagging them. This can be useful for determining who has both of 2 roles, for example. 

Josephine can add emojis given a link with **!addemoji**. The user saying it must have permissions to manage emoji on the server. 

Josephine's function list can be accessed by typing **!help**. 

Besides her usual message information functions, she can also do these miscellaneous functions:

**!define** will take the following word and give a definition from Google, including an audio reply.
